                My past projects have focused on events at the centre of sudden and irrevocable change. Working with the Sudetenland expulsions of 1946 and the rapid demise of the coal mining industry in France and the UK. I am fascinated by what happens between such events and our later interpretations of them.

                <p>
                I am less concerned with historical representations of these places and events than I am with uncovering the stories of the people who experienced them. Through working closely with these people I have come to understand remembering as a process of accumulation, modification and forgetting. Remembering is a process which belongs to the present.    
                </p>
                <p>
                The question at the heart of my research is how can I uncover these places and events which are embodied within this process of remembering? And in turn, how can I reveal this process as an experience into which the viewer can enter?

                To provide a context for my research I am using the village of Srbska, previously Wunschendorf. Over the past decade I have come to know this village intimately. Collecting an extensive archive* and  ongoing relationship with people who have lived there, namely a German group who have been returning annually since 2009. Last year I filmed their final return, 70 years after they were exiled.  Through looking for different contexts I realised that no other place could provide a more personal or appropriate foundation into my research into the process of ‘re-membering’ than the village of Srbska, a place I lived in between 2007-2012 and to which I continue to return.

                <p>
                The question of how this village was, is, or will be, is something which haunts me. I continue to return, and with each return my own narrative of the place is re-written, an accumulative process of remembering and forgetting which is in increasingly influenced by other people’s stories rooted in the same physical location. - Extract from personal notebooks (December 2014)

                Wünschendorf was a thriving border village with over one hundred and fifty houses and six hundred residents. Nestled in the ancient Sudete mountain range, it belonged to an area known as the Sudetenland. Over the past century, the village has belonged to Austria Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Germany and today lies in the Czech Republic, sharing a border with Poland. Following the Munich Agreement in 1939 ﻿Wünschendorf was annexed from Czechoslovakia and absorbed into Greater Germany. An event which was shortly followed by the surrender of the entire country to German rule. During these years the tension between the inhabitants of the Sudetenland and their fellow countrymen in Czechoslovakia became so great that in the year following the end of the war almost the entire population of  ﻿Wünschendorf  was forcibly exiled. An exile which affected an estimated 3,000,000 Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia alone.

                As the residents of Wünschendorf were being moved from the village new inhabitants were choosing which of their homes to occupy. Travelling from Czechoslovakia and other allied countries these new residents were to take over the farms and businesses the Germans left behind, to fill the space filled by almost a third of Czechoslovakia's population. In Wunschendorf, what happened after these events is little known. Waves of people moved through the village to work on farms which were shortly occupied by the Communist regime. What is known is that the village of Wunschendorf was renamed Srbska and Srbska is the village I moved to in 2007.

                Srbska is an isolated village at the edge of the Czech Republic border to Poland. With just a handful of houses and a few families it is place referred to by locals ‘as the end of the world’. When I moved there in 2007 I had no idea of its past, of what had been there before but over the years the absence which permeates Srbska was occupied by fragments of stories, of glimpses into a village which had been dis-membered.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since  2009 a  group of Residents exiled from Wünschendorf  in 1946 have been returning to Srbska on an annual visit to their village. We met by chance in 2010 when I discovered them in fields near to my house, pointing and referring to Wünschendorf, a village I couldn’t see.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the past decade I have been working closely with this group,  recording their testimonies through a process which has taken me to Germany, Poland and back to Srbska again and again. In 2010 I  co-founded an Non Governmental Organisation to tell ‘the’ story of the village, to acknowledge and preserve it from being forgotten and through my research process have accumulated photographs, documents, objects and stories which are now in an online archive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Yet, the more I accumulate the more challenging it becomes to present a single plausible narrative of the village. For it is not just a the German group’s and my personal narrative which I have been encountering. The turbulent and contested history of the village has brought about the collective stories from many groups who have lived or continue to live there. From the Romany gypsy and Vietnamese inhabitants who have lived there over the years, to the Polish and Czech residents who live in the village today. Each story I’m told presents a different perspective, a different version of the past. 
                </p>
                <p>
                It is precisely these details, these events and places pushed forwards from the past which open up the possibility of multiple interpretations and therefore multiple possible stories rooted in the same place. A shift from a single linear narrative toward many single linear narratives, which do not replace one another, rather, which coexist. Over the years my desire to preserve a story of this village, to stop it from being forgotten has become a greater enquiry into how to decide what is remembered of the past? Which stories should we remember and how can the viewer play an active role in that process?
