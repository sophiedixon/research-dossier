            ‘Space defines landscape whereas space combined with memory defines place’  Lucy Lippard

            Place, commonly perceived as something we inhabit, is also something we experience. As Lucy Lippard describes is, place is ‘something seen from the inside’. As a creator, I am fascinated with how places are experienced, both by myself and by others.

            To be a recollection, rather than a fantasy, the memory of a place must be rooted in facts, and artefacts. But what happens to our memories of the past when the physical places they reference threaten to disappear? What happens when multiple stories of the past reside in the same place? Which stories of the past can we believe?

            The context for this experiment is 'Scholz's House', a ruin in a remote village of Srbská in today's Czech Republic.
